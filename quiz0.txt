# Welcome to EECS 481! This reading comprehension quiz, "Quiz 0", assesses your retention of course logistics and the first readings. In the future, many quizzes will be on Gradescope, will be shorter, will have a time limit, and will only allow one submission.  

# You must complete this quiz, and all other reading quizzes, alone. 

# Edit and submit this file to Autograder.io . Because we want to introduce you to these concepts and ensure that everyone understands them, you can submit Quiz 0 as many times as you like until you have a perfect score. (Autograder.io may report the quiz grade as out of 11, but in our gradebook calculations it is out of 10 with on potential point of extra credit. So if you end up with 11/11 displayed, that's really a 11/10 score for this quiz.) There is no time limit and no submission limit for this first introductory quiz only. We'll use your highest-scoring submission.


# Uncomment a single answer for each question so that your one selected answer starts at the very beginning of the line. Leave the answer identifier (Ax-y) unchanged. Example: 

A0-1. This is a correctly-selected answer for Question 0 (with Option 1 selected). It does not start with a # or space. 
# A0-2. This answer is not selected because it is on a line that starts with "# ". 
         A0-3. This answer is also not selected, even though the "#" has been removed, because it starts with whitespace.

# Submit this file via autograder.io . (Future quizzes may use gradescope as well, and you may have to check there to see quiz availability. These are sometimes called "pop" or "surprise" quizzes. Be sure to look there in the future!) 

Q1. What should I do if I think I might miss attending a lecture or completing a course assignment because of outside circumstances (e.g., illness, self-isolation for COVID exposure, travel difficulties, etc.)? 

# A1-1. Post a private message on the course Piazza forum explaining your circumstances.
# A1-2. Email one of the course staff members individually explaining your circumstances. 
A1-3. Email EECS481Staff@gmail.com providing your evidence, explaining your circumstances, and listing the days you will be impacted. 
# A1-4. There is nothing I can do: the course only allows two absences. 


Q2. To what degree are students responsible for checking course websites, such as Piazza, Gradescope, and Autograder.io? 

# A2-1. Students are responsible for checking course websites, but all important updates will also be emailed, bypassing student notification preferences. 
A2-2. Students are responsible for checking course websites. Some important information, including the presence of timed quizzes, may only be visible to you if you manually check course websites. 
# A2-3. Students need not check individual websites: all important information will be posted on Canvas.
# A2-4. The instructors commonly push back deadlines on course websites, since pushing back deadlines is always equitable to all students. 
# A2-5. The course does not require students to manually check for assignment information because scheduling, planning, risk and uncertainty are not course topics.


Q3. A student is studying the night before Exam 1 by reading the exams we provide from previous semesters. In one previous semester, Exam 1 featured a question on Delta Debugging. The student checks and does not find Delta Debugging in the lectures or readings so far. Based on a careful reading of the relevant course webpages, what should the student do? 

A3-1. The student can conclude that Delta Debugging will not be on Exam 1 this semester because the lecture covering Delta Debugging is after the Exam 1 date this semester (even if it was on Exam 1 in a previous semester). 
# A3-2. The student can conclude that the last lecture before the Exam is not covered on the Exam.
# A3-3. The student should devote a significant amount of time to studying Delta Debugging for Exam 1, even though it has not been covered in class or in the readings. 
# A3-4. The student can conclude that Delta Debugging was present in an Optional Reading or that information from Optional Readings might be necessary for non-optional Exam questions.


Q4. A student is working on Homework 1. The student has found some interesting test cases and images online and on the course webpage and wonders about submitting them for credit. How is this handled in 481? 

# A4-1. Submitting work that is not your own, even if you cite it, is a violation of academic integrity (is "cheating") for 481. 
# A4-2. You can submit work with your partner and you can use and modify files from the course webpage, but you can't use arbitrary files from the Internet.
# A4-3. Using information from Stack Overflow posts or similar websites is a violation of academic integrity because it involves the thoughts or work of another person.
# A4-4. Using information from the web is fine if it is small, but if you find some webpage or archive that clearly just directly answers a homework question, you can't submit that, even if you cite it, because it would be blatantly cheating.
A4-5. You can submit test cases, images, files, code, and/or text, modified or unmodified, from the course webpages, random webpages, and/or sites like Stack Overflow if you cite it. Even though this is very scary to some students, it is the course policy (because it is closer to real-world software engineering).  


Q5. You are working on HW1 and encounter this Java problem: https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/481/readings/quiz0-screenshot.png . Based on a careful reading of the HW1 specification, which of these actions is most likely to fix your issue?

# A5-1. sudo apt-get install libz-dev 
# A5-2. editing the pom.xml file 
# A5-3. renaming the test case to match the class declared inside it
A5-4. sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
# A5-5. removing all references to the GUI from the test case
# A5-6. avoiding non-ASCII characters


Q6. You are working on HW2 (!) and the AFL tool is taking a long time. You want to kill it so that you can use your computer for an assignment in another class, but you feel uncertain. Which of these best characterizes the situation for 481? (This question is asking you to practice your reading skills on the HW2 specification, even though HW2 is not due until after HW1.) 

# A6-1. Stopping and restarting AFL will overwrite the findings/plot_data file, and there is no way to back up that file, and that file is necessary to create the plot for the writeup, so you cannot kill AFL. 
# A6-2. You can back up important AFL files, but even if you do, there will be a large time discontinuity in the plot you produce, which will cause you to lose points. 
# A6-3. Unlike EvoSuite, which can be stopped and restarted, AFL cannot be, so you are out of luck and must let AFL run.
A6-4. You should check to see if you already have 510 paths total. If you do, you're already done and can Ctrl-C AFL. If not, you can safely Ctrl-C AFL, back up the important data, and restart AFL later.
# A6-5. You can make AFL complete more quickly by seeding it with many large image files.

Q7. Which of these options best characterizes a claim in S. Keshav's "How to Read a Paper"?

# A7-1. Students should read papers in-order, depth-first style, to ensure that they see all of the terms defined before they are used. 
A7-2. Students should read papers in multiple iterations. Each iteration considers the content in more depth.
# A7-3. Students can safely ignore charts and plots and tables in papers and focus on details of the text instead. 
# A7-4. Students do not benefit from considering a list of questions to keep in mind while reading a paper.

Q8. In Buse and Zimmermann's "Information Needs for Software Development Analytics", which of these factors was not among the top three most important, as identified by managers and developers, when making decisions?

# A8-1. Customer Input
# A8-2. Data / Metrics
A8-3. Team planning
# A8-4. Personal Experience

Q9. In Buse and Zimmermann's "Information Needs for Software Development Analytics", which of these decision scenarios was claimed to have the best potential to use analytics related to understanding customers?

# A9-1. Targeted Testing
# A9-2. Targeted Refactoring
A9-3. Release Planning
# A9-4. Judging Stability

Q10. (Extra Credit) In Anda et al.'s "Variability and Reproducibility in Software Engineering: A Study of Four Companies that Developed the Same System", which of these best describes was the relationship between cost/schedule overruns and the size of the delivered product? (Students may find this question more difficult than the others, since we are asking for a conclusion that the paper does not call out directly.) 

# A10-1. There was no relationship between the firm price and planned time schedule for the companies that provided lead times.
# A10-2. Overruns on the time schedules were expected for the companies with the lowest lead-time estimate.
# A10-3. The agreed time schedule was the basis for calculating the overrun of the projects.
A10-4. Companies A and C had the largest overruns and also turned in the systems with the fewest lines of code, suggesting that even small systems can have high variability.
# A10-5. Company D had the smallest overrun but turned in the least tight class cohesion.
